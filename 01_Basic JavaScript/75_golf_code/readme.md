# Golf Code
In the game of Golf, each hole has a par, meaning, the average number of strokes a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in the hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there is a different nickname.

par and strokes will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.
