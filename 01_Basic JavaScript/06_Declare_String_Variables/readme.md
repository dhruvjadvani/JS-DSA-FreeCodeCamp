Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:
```javascript
var myName;
```
But you can also declare a string variable like this:
```javascript
var myName = "your name";
```
"your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
