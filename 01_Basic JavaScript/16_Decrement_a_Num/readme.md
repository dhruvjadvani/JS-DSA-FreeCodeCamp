# Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the ```--``` operator.
```javascript
i--;
```
is the equivalent of
```javascript
i = i - 1;
```
Note: The entire line becomes ```i--;```, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

# Problem Statement
Change the code to use the ```--``` operator on ```myVar```.
