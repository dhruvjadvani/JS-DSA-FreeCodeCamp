# Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the ```*``` symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example
```javascript
const myVar = 13 * 13;
```
```myVar``` would have the value ```169```.

# Problem Statement
Change the ```0``` so that product will equal ```80```.
