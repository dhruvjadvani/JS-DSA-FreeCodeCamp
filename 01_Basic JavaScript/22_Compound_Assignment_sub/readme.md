# Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the ```+=``` operator, ```-=``` subtracts a number from a variable.
```
myVar = myVar - 5;
```
will subtract ```5``` from ```myVar```. This can be rewritten as:
```
myVar -= 5;
```
# problem statement
Convert the assignments for ```a```, ```b```, and ```c``` to use the ```-=``` operator.
