# Add Two Numbers with JavaScript
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:
```javascript
const myVar = 5 + 10;
```
myVar now has the value 15.
