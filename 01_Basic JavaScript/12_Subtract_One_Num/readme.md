# Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the ```-``` symbol for subtraction.

Example
```javascript
const myVar = 12 - 6;
```
```myVar``` would have the value ```6```.

# Problem Statement
Change the ```0``` so the difference is ```12```.
